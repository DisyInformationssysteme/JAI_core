<h3><a name="License"></a>License</h3>
<p>The source code for the core Java Advanced Imaging API reference
implementation
is licensed under the <a href="https://jai.dev.java.net/jrl.html"
 target="_blank">Java
Research License (JRL)</a> for non-commercial use. The JRL allows users
to download, build, and modify the source code in the
jai-core project for research use, subject to the terms of the license.
</p>
<p>Java Advanced Imaging is also licensed for commercial use under a
new
no-fee <a href="https://jai.dev.java.net/jdl-jai.pdf" target="_blank">Java
Distribution License (JDL)</a>. The JDL
allows commercial use of Java Advanced Imaging with or without
modification, as
long as compatibility with the entire API Specification is maintained.
This includes passing the TCK tests for Java Advanced Imaging, and
retaining the
javax namespace as defined by the JCP.
</p>
<p>
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community participation, and
encourage developers to contribute both bug fixes and new
implementation code to the API. The combination of the JRL and the JDL
was chosen to facilitate this, while ensuring the integrity and
compatibility of the API.<br>

<h3><a name="Reporting_Issues"></a>Reporting Issues<br>
</h3>
<p>We have set up the <a
 href="https://jai-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue
Tracker</a>
in this
project
to track issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) for
Java Advanced Imaging reference implementation related issues. </p>
<p>The following subcomponents exist in the jai-core project's
Issue Tracker:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>build: Issues with the jai-core build process<br>
  </li>
  <li>codec: Issues with the codec classes in the
com.sun.media.jai.codec.* and com.sun.media.jai.codecimpl.* packages<br>
  </li>
  <li>implementation: Issues with the reference implementation for
jai-core<br>
  </li>
  <li>medialib: Issues with the native medialib implementation for
jai-core<br>
  </li>
  <li>specification: Issues with the jai-core specification<br>
  </li>
  <li>www: Issues with the jai-core web pages</li>
  <li>other: Issues that cannot be categorized into any of the above<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember
to take a little time when filing a bug report -- make sure you can
reproduce the problem, and be very explicit in your description of the
problem. If there's something you'd like to see and don't, or something
you can imagine being improved, let us know by filing an enhancement
request. Use the project's Issue Tracker and file an "Enhancement"
rather than a "Defect". </p>
<p>This project has its own issues mailing list.&nbsp;<a
 href="https://jai-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to the issues mailing list described below:</p>

<h3><a name="Feedback_and_Discussion"></a>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>Through the JAI forum and mailing lists, people using the software
can benefit from each others' expertise. To be really useful, the lists
need <i>your</i> input! Please don't be afraid to post -- help out
others when you can; post your questions, comments, and ideas as you
see fit.</p>
<p>We have created four Java Advanced Imaging mailing lists in the
parent <a href="http://jai.dev.java.net/">jai</a> project: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">announce@jai.dev.java.net</span>
  </li>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">interest@jai.dev.java.net</span></li>
  <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">issues@jai.dev.java.net</li>
  <li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">cvs@jai.dev.java.net</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://jai.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to any of these lists. </p>
<p>The <span style="font-style: italic;">announce</span> list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java Advanced Imaging
related news and information. The <span style="font-style: italic;">interest</span>
list is an open mailing list for discussing all aspects of the Java
Advanced Imaging API, the reference implementation for the Java
Advanced Imaging core, demo programs etc. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">issues</span>
list is for automated issues tracking (for issues in the parent jai web
pages only), and the <span style="font-style: italic;">cvs</span> list
is for automated CVS
change messages (for changes to the parent jai web pages only).</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a mailing list, we have created the <a
 href="http://jai.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView">Java Advanced
Imaging API forum</a>, hosted as part of the JavaDesktop Community.
Messages posted on the forum are cross-posted to <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">interest@jai.dev.java.net</span> and
vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the issues mailing list mentioned in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Reporting Issues</span> section above,
each sub-project also has its own cvs mailing list.&nbsp;<a
 href="https://jai-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to the cvs mailing list described below: </p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">cvs@jai-core.dev.java.net</span>
list is for automated CVS change messages and discussion of those
changes </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Project_Highlights"></a>Project Highlights
</h3>
<p><b>Release project Source code</b> </p>
<p>The current Java Advanced Imaging source
code is version 1.1.3. It is
available for download from the CVS repository of this project. The
following page describes the <a
 href="https://jai.dev.java.net/cvs-tags.html">naming scheme for CVS
tags</a> used in this project.
The root of this release is
tagged as <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">root-1_1_3</span>
and the latest version is tagged <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);">jai-1_1_3-alpha
</span>in the CVS repository.
The source code can be retrieved either by a simple cvs checkout for
the latest release or the
tag can be used to retrieve a specific version from the CVS repository.
</p>
<p>The latest source release differs from the released 1.1.2_01 version
in
the following
ways:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Apache Ant is now used to build Java Advanced Imaging</li>
  <li>1.1.3 is the next version of Java Advanced Imaging being
currently worked upon. 64 bit support and bug fixes for identified bugs
will be added to the source code as part of this version.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java Advanced Imaging 1.1.3_x bug
fixes</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will work with the community to address bugs identified in
Java Advanced Imaging
1.1.2_01, and will release new versions of Java Advanced Imaging
1.1.3_x as
needed.
Bug fixes will be immediately available in the CVS source, or from the
weekly builds that we intend to set up at a later time on this site. We
will release official 1.1.3_x versions as needed. 1.1.3-alpha has been
released and the next
release that we are currently working on is 1.1.3-beta.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java Advanced Imaging 2.0</span><br>
</p>
<p>We intend to file a new JSR under the Java
Community Process (JCP), and form an Expert Group of community
members to
design and implement the next version of the Java Advanced Imaging API.
The scope of this release will be driven by the JSR Expert Group.
Prospective features include image analysis and understanding
capabilities, volumetric imaging, and any of the project suggestions
below which affect the public API defined by the javax.media.jai
package hierarchy. Suggestions for features to include in the next JSR
are of course welcome.</p>
<h3><a name="Project_Suggestions"></a>Project Suggestions
</h3>
<p>Here are some project ideas for the jai-core project.<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>API to track image operation progress</li>
  <li>Disk-based TileCache</li>
  <li>Local adaptive histogram equalization operation</li>
  <li>Programmatic mechanism to detect use of native operations</li>
  <li>Base class for operations on unions of sources</li>
  <li>Make OperationNodes sensitive to RenderingChangeEvents generated
by operation parameters</li>
  <li>Chain code extraction<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Demos"></a>Demos</h3>
The <a href="https://jai-demos.dev.java.net/">jai-demos</a>
project includes two sets of demonstration programs. The first category
are simple demo programs that may demonstrate a single JAI feature. The
second category are more comprehensive demo applications that may
demonstrate multiple JAI features and provide for interactive
user experience through the extensive use of GUI elements.
